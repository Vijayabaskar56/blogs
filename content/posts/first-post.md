# My Own Corner of the Internet

This is My first Blog in my personal site, so it not for you if you are reading this , **PLEASE DON'T READ THIS..!!!**

This is for Myself to read in future, sometime from now, so I wanted to leave a message here, 

Hey man, you always be the Consumer and not a creater, who is closed, and doesn't share any thing with anyone, or share what you doing and what you are planning, what on your mind, and what you perceptive about something, stuffs like that and because you have this feeling of what it doing to do any way, is my perceptive really even matter, and what changes does it going to bring.

But Today I wanted to Change that feeling that I have , and here to the my own little corner of the intenet, and even if no body reads or care, just share the stuff's man, share what are you up to , what you learnin planning , experience, and it doesn't have to help any one, let it be the purpose to help you when you forgot stuffs that you learn, let it be the remainder of the feeling that you have in a part of life, *let it be Your Own Corner of the Internet*.
