It's day two , and like I said yestarday I wanted to document my journey, so here I am,

I started to working on my app and what I have done today is just build the navigation of the app, and decided how many screens it going to have and what are the main thing to focus on.

Screen 1 : list of Songs alogn with the search bar
Screen 2 : creat room discover rooms,
Screen 3 : account

these are the 3 main screen and I am planning to finish the UI side of the app in over the weekends before monday , and I also thought of it would be great to share my journey on the twitter or X, need to decided that on tomorrow,

Next today , I attended the lab session, it way nice the buildspace team having fun, and it was nice pounder around other ideas.

I share the process along with the image tomorrow, peach ✌️.
