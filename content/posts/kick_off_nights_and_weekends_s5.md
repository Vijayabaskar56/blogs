I have participating in the Nights and Weekends Season 5 of BuildSpace, so this blog is about, 

what heck is that ?
why am I excited about ?

what is the plan and other stuffs.

[BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so) is a home for ppl bringing their wildest ideas to life and every year they conduce a event named Weekends and Nights. The general Idea behind the event is that anybody can join with a idea of their own and gave life to those ideas, over the six week period.

I heard about it previous year and so when I know about the this season, I joined randomly and I just completed my first lecture from farza the founder of buidschool himself.

I belive it will be a challening and exciting ride and I don't wanna miss the ride so I hope in,

## The Idea

![my idea](/erevald.png)

This is my idea for the nights and weekends, I am going to build a app with react-native based on this idea.
I didn't know react-native , I am planning to learn react-native and build this app while in the process of making it

I wanna say lot about and explain lot about the idea, but the thing is , it better to make it happen than to explain it in 5 paragraphs.

## The Plan

Around 70,000 application was received for this season of night and weekly, I just get to know that and I also know that from this only a 10 to 20 will make it to all the six week and I wanted to be among one of those people, so I am going to gave everything that I have on this one and the plan it make it to the end , that its as simple as its get, just make it to the end.

I am also planning to document this journey throught, twitter as well as this blog, so I am going to keep update my progress on this blog, along these six weeks, all the way.
