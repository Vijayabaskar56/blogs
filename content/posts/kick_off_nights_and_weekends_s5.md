I am participating in the Nights and Weekends Season 5 of BuildSpace, so this blog is about:

- What the heck is that?
- Why am I excited about it?
- What is the plan and other stuff.

[BuildSpace](https://buildspace.so) is a home for people bringing their wildest ideas to life, and every year they conduct an event named Nights and Weekends. The general idea behind the event is that anybody can join with an idea of their own and bring it to life over a six-week period.

I heard about it last year, so when I knew about this season, I joined randomly and I just completed my first lecture from Farza, the founder of BuildSpace, himself.

I believe it will be a challenging and exciting ride, and I don't want to miss it, so I hopped in.

## The Idea

![my idea](/erevald.png)

This is my idea for Nights and Weekends. I am going to build an app with React Native based on this idea. I don't know React Native yet, but I am planning to learn it and build this app during the process.

I want to say a lot about and explain a lot about the idea, but the thing is, it's better to make it happen than to explain it in 5 paragraphs.

## The Plan

Around 70,000 applications were received for this season of Nights and Weekends. I just got to know that, and I also know that from these, only 10 to 20 will make it through all six weeks. I want to be among those people, so I am going to give everything I have on this one. The plan is to make it to the end. That's as simple as it gets: just make it to the end.

I am also planning to document this journey through Twitter as well as this blog, so I am going to keep updating my progress on this blog throughout these six weeks, all the way.
